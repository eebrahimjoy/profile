            Galaxy Auto Auction Mobile App is a user-friendly platform designed to provide users with access to
            auctioned vehicles. Users can create their profile, reset their password, and upload necessary documents
            for verification purposes. The app allows users to bid online and offline, and to view a list of their
            won, lost, and pending bids. Users can also view their account information, including their payment
            history and credit balance. The app provides users with various search options, including saved searches
