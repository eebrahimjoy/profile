          I was born in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. My childhood memories are filled
          with delightful moments spent with my parents in Mymensingh, where I
          received my primary education
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I moved to Sreepur, Gazipur, for my secondary education, which
          I recall as the most memorable time of my life. I successfully passed
          my Secondary School Certificate with a fantastic grade of 4.56 out of
          5.00, majoring in Science, from Treemohoni School
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I moved to Dhaka and enrolled at Holy Child College in
          Uttara, where I lived in a hostel and pursued my passion for science.
          In 2014, I completed my Higher Secondary Certificate with flying
          colors, scoring a perfect grade of 5.00 out of 5.00
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology has always fascinated me, I decided to pursue a degree
          in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International
          University. During my academic journey, I participated in numerous
          math olympiads, programming contests, and annual tours with my friends
          and soulmates to places like Cox's Bazar, Saint Martin, and Kuakata.
          However, just before completing my graduation in 2018, I lost my
          father on November 17, 2018, at Mymensing Medical Hospital. Despite
          this setback, I completed my graduation with a commendable CGPA of
          3.79 out of 4.00 in January 2019
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my studies, I gained experience working in various
          organizations, which I have detailed in my experience section. I got
          married on September 17, 2021, and in February 2023, I moved to Dubai,
          UAE, for job purposes. Currently, I reside in International City,
          Dubai, UAE. I am grateful for my life journey, which has taught me the
          value of hard work, dedication, and the joy of learning and growing in
          the field of technology.
