    <h1>Galaxy Auction</h1>
    <h4>Platform: iOS and Android - Flutter</h4>
    <p>
        Galaxy Auto Auction Mobile App is a user-friendly platform designed to provide users with access to
        auctioned vehicles. Users can create their profile, reset their password, and upload necessary documents
        for verification purposes. The app allows users to bid online and offline, and to view a list of their
        won, lost, and pending bids. Users can also view their account information, including their payment
        history and credit balance. The app provides users with various search options, including saved searches
        and a watchlist feature. The search function allows users to find vehicles based on specific criteria,
        such as make, model, year, and location. The auction list view also includes a calendar, allowing users
        to easily view upcoming auctions and plan their bidding strategy accordingly.
