          During my internship at Nerd Castle Limited, I began my programming
          journey and gained valuable experience in object-oriented programming
          (OOP) concepts using Java. I put these concepts into practice by
          creating several demo Android projects, including Kenakata, where I
          utilized Map, Marker, and API. Later on my internship, I was onboarded
          onto live projects such as Uqeel and Layer apps, where I worked
          collaboratively with a team to develop Android applications using
          Java. In addition to coding, I also gained experience managing version
          control using Git and participating in agile development processes
          such as Scrum meetings.
